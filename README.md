# Multi-threaded card simulation

## Running the game
To get started, run the CardGame.java file. Enter the number of players and the location of the .txt file, and then the game is played. At the end, there is a message printed to the terminal window stating the player who has won. There are also output files for each player (with their actions during the course of the game e.g., player _ discards _ to the deck _) and deck (with the contents of each deck at the end of the game). 

## Testing
